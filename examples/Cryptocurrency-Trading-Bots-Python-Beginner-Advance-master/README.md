Hello and welcome to the code repository of @BlockchainEng Joaquin Roibal.

This Github Repository is used as a collection of python codes that you may find useful for **making your own cryptocurrency trading bots or applying advanced trading strategies (Triangular Arbitrage, Market Making) to the cryptocurrency markets.** Among other useful tools. 

You may want to begin by watching my youtube video channel on introduction to crypto bot trading or advanced strategies such as triangular arbitrage, which will help you to understand the purpose and reasoning behind the code in this repo.

## Getting Started with Crypto Trading Bot Software

The purpose of these bots is to implement an advanced strategy of cryptocurrency trading on a cryptocurrency exchange, such as Binance. You will need a computer, a binance account, and a copy of this code. You will be able to run this bot as a software to make profitable trades for you.

To run any of these bots, first download the Roibal fork of 'Python-Binance', install or unzip this code on your computer. Then place whatever bot from this folder (RoibalBot.py) in the Python-Binance/Examples folder and run/edit that file with whatever python IDE you would like. For the more advanced bots you will need to install CCXT (can be installed via pip or pycharm install).

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
